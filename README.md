## Project Overview
QuickFactChecker Dashboard allows users to:
- Explore the LIAR dataset (training, test, validation)
- Analyze model performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Make live predictions on new text inputs
- Visualize feature importance using LIME explanations

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11  
- Streamlit 1.30  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- LIME

### Future Integration Suggestions

- Deploy on cloud platforms (Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit Cloud, AWS)
- Add multi-language support
- Include more advanced NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa)
- Real-time API for automatic news validation
